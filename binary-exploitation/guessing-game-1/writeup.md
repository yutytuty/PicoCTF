# Guessing Game 1
1. The C rand() function returns the same sequence of numbers each run.
    - Open gdb and look for the answer. 
    - Looking at line do_stuff+122
    ```as
    0x400c14 <do_stuff+122>   cmp    rax, QWORD PTR [rbp-0x10]
    ```
    - view memory at `[rbp-0x10]` to get answer with `hexdump byte $rbp-0x10`
    ```
    0x00007fffffffdf60     54 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 80 1a 40 00 00 00 00 00    T.........@.....
    ```
    - Answer is 0x54 which is 84
2. The win function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The winner buffer is 100 bytes long but fgets reads 360 bytes.
    - Find the offset length which is 120 bytes.
3. Start building a ROP chain to execute `/bin/sh`
    - The execve paramaters are passed in the `rax`, `rdx`, `rdi`, `rsi`.
    ```
    rax = 0x3B (execve syscall number)
    rdx
    ```
